"""
Soul loop controller for Khassandra Ascension.

The :class:`SoulLoopController` orchestrates the interaction between
Khassandra's memory, emotion and reflection engines.  It repeatedly
executes cycles that update emotional state, process new memories,
generate reflections, and can be extended via a proprietary hook
``_soul_cycle`` for custom behaviour.
